    <h1>CSS 3D Business Card</h1>
<p>Prior to the current iteration of my website, I had a simple 'digital business-card'
front page. The skeumorphic-cards theme lives on in my current site; although with
more correct HTML and without flashy flipping effects.</p>
<p>Born out of an experiment in making a realistic-looking postcard with CSS 3D
transforms (and without Javascript), I spent a fair amount of time tweaking the CSS -
its not just a simple 3d flip; the gradients, edges, and debossed shadows of the text
transition to mimic how light would hit the card.</p>
<p>The HTML behind the card is an unfortunately non-semantic use of the <code>&lt;checkbox&gt;</code>
element and <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> to enable clicking anywhere on the card to flip to the other side.
The CSS was hand-written and all units were originally in <code>px</code>, which were converted
without modification straight to <code>rem</code> to allow the demo to scale down for small
screens.</p>
<p>See the live effect below - unfortunately CSS 3d-transforms require hardware
acceleration, so the effect does not work on some mobile browsers.</p>
