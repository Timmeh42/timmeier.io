    <h1>CSS 3D Business Card</h1>
<p>Prior to the current iteration of my website, I had a simple 'digital business-card'
front page. The skeumorphic-cards theme lives on in my current site; although
with more correct HTML and without flashy flipping effects.</p>
<p>Born out of an experiment in making a realistic-looking postcard with
CSS 3D transforms (and without Javascript), I spent a fair amount of time tweaking
every aspect of this business card - the subtle gradients, background shadow, and
even the shadows on the faux-embossed text transition between shades when flipping
the card over.</p>
<p>The HTML behind the card is an awfully non-semantic use of the <code>&lt;checkbox&gt;</code> element
and <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> to enable clicking anywhere on the card to flip to the other side.</p>
<p>See the live effect below - unfortunately CSS 3d-transforms require hardware
acceleration, so the effect does not work on some mobile browsers.</p>
